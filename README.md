## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add open https://simonmisencik.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo open` to see the charts.
